# PDAC_DEG_ANALYSIS
Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma using SVM
This project involves identifying key differentially expressed genes for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Skills applied :
- Python, R language
- Machine Learning
- Bioinformatics Analysis
- Graph theory

ToolAs used : 
- scikit-learn
- Networkx (Graph theory)
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc

## Objectives
- Analyze microarray gene expression data for PDAC
- Identify DEGs using statistical and machine learning methods
- Build SVM classification models for early detection

## Key Components
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Feature selection using statistical & ML techniques
- SVM model training, testing, and validation
- Visualization of Confusion Matrix

## Results
- Achieved high classification accuracy for PDAC vs. normal
- Identified top biomarker candidates with strong diagnostic potential
